Description: Implements the Adaptive Generative Bootstrap (AGB) method, which has
    been proposed to improve coverage probability in small-sample and multimodal
    settings. Variable-bandwidth kernel density estimation is combined with
    generative resampling to produce robust bootstrap replicates.
